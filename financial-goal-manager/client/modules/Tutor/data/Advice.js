        your emergency fund is lower than 3-6 months of expenses. Emergency expenses can take many forms,

        They can sometimes come in multiples - remember, when it rains, it pours!

        Based on our information, you hold a lot of savings in <strong>cash</strong>.
        Unlike our other pieces of advice, this one should be taken with a grain of salt and depends on factors
        such as the state of the <strong>financial market</strong>, your age, your <strong>risk tolerance</strong>
        and your ability to hold your investments during a <strong>market downturn</strong>. While the stock market
        has historically gone up, past data does not guarantee future data.
        Our goal is to help you make an informed decision, so our useful links will include articles that encourage
        cash savings, as well as articles that discourage holding too much of your savings in cash.
      </p>),
      (<p key={'p2'}>
        Holding too much money in cash that earns less than 1% in interest may prevent you from building wealth
        and retiring comfortably. Historically, the stock market has earned an <strong>average</strong> of 7% yearly returns.
        The word average here is important - some years the market can go down tens of percents, while another year it might
        go up 30%. The key to seeing the coveted 7% is to stay in the market for as long as possible. The stock market is only one
        investment option, but it is usually the most suitable for individuals who want to keep it simple.
        There are many ways of getting into the stock market. You can have as much or as little control as you'd like.
        Investments can be done automatically through tools like <a href='https://www.betterment.com/'>Betterment</a> or you can choose your own stocks by opening
        a brokerage account from with one of <a href='https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/best-online-brokers-for-stock-trading/'>these</a> institutions.
      </p>),
      (<p key={'p3'}>
        Building wealth is the least straightforward decision out of all the advice we could give you.
        We recommend getting informed before making risky investments in individual stocks.
        There is nothing wrong with sticking to simple investments like the <strong>S&P 500</strong>,
        but there is also nothing wrong with using <strong>some</strong> of your excess money for fun investments.

        No investment strategy pays off as well or is less risky than eliminating high interest debt.
        Most credit cards charge high interest rates -- as much as 18% or more - if you donâ€™t pay off your balance in full each month.
